# Summer project

This is a simple webpage where our main focus was to try AR from Apple. 
We also added a chatbot and carousel from React and styled the page with Bootstrap. 

If you want to check out our page make sure you try it in a mobile version in Safari so you can try the AR function. :sparkles:
